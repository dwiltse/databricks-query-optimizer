# Unified Dashboard Architecture

## Overview
This document describes the unified dashboard that combines your existing **cost optimization** capabilities with the new **query performance optimization** features.

## Dashboard Structure

## Integration Points

### ðŸ”„ Data Flow Between Schemas
```sql
-- Example: Cost impact of performance optimizations
SELECT 
    co.user_name,
    co.total_cost,
    qo.avg_optimization_score,
    qo.optimization_opportunity_score,
    -- Calculate potential cost savings from performance optimization
    co.total_cost * (10 - qo.avg_optimization_score) / 10 * 0.3 as potential_cost_savings
FROM mcp.cost_optimization.user_cost_attribution co
JOIN mcp.query_optimization.mv_user_performance qo 
    ON co.user_name = qo.user_id
WHERE co.date >= current_date() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS
    AND qo.avg_optimization_score < 7;
```

### ðŸ“Š Cross-Schema Queries

#### 1. Cost-Performance Correlation
```sql
-- Identify users with high cost AND poor performance
SELECT 
    co.user_name,
    co.total_cost,
    co.avg_query_cost,
    qo.avg_duration_ms,
    qo.avg_optimization_score,
    qo.optimization_opportunity_score,
    -- Combined priority score
    (co.total_cost / 100) + (10 - qo.avg_optimization_score) + qo.optimization_opportunity_score as priority_score
FROM mcp.cost_optimization.user_cost_attribution co
JOIN mcp.query_optimization.mv_user_performance qo ON co.user_name = qo.user_id
WHERE co.date >= current_date() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS
ORDER BY priority_score DESC;
```

#### 2. Optimization Impact on Cost
```sql
-- Track how performance optimizations affect cost
SELECT 
    ot.optimization_type,
    ot.optimization_description,
    AVG(ot.cost_improvement_pct) as avg_cost_improvement,
    SUM(ot.actual_monthly_savings_usd) as total_cost_savings,
    -- Correlate with cost optimization metrics
    AVG(co.cost_usd) as avg_user_cost_before,
    AVG(co.cost_usd * (1 - ot.cost_improvement_pct/100)) as estimated_cost_after
FROM mcp.query_optimization.optimization_tracking ot
JOIN mcp.cost_optimization.user_cost_attribution co 
    ON ot.user_id = co.user_name
WHERE ot.implementation_date >= current_date() - INTERVAL 30 DAYS
    AND co.date >= current_date() - INTERVAL 30 DAYS
GROUP BY ot.optimization_type, ot.optimization_description
ORDER BY total_cost_savings DESC;
```

#### 3. Resource Efficiency Score
```sql
-- Combined efficiency score using both cost and performance data
SELECT 
    co.workspace_id,
    co.workspace_name,
    co.efficiency_score as cost_efficiency,
    qo.avg_optimization_score as performance_efficiency,
    -- Combined efficiency score (1-10)
    (co.efficiency_score + qo.avg_optimization_score) / 2 as combined_efficiency_score,
    -- Recommendations based on combined score
    CASE 
        WHEN co.efficiency_score < 0.5 AND qo.avg_optimization_score < 5 THEN 'CRITICAL: Both cost and performance need immediate attention'
        WHEN co.efficiency_score < 0.5 THEN 'HIGH: Focus on cost optimization'
        WHEN qo.avg_optimization_score < 5 THEN 'HIGH: Focus on performance optimization'
        WHEN (co.efficiency_score + qo.avg_optimization_score) / 2 < 6 THEN 'MEDIUM: General optimization recommended'
        ELSE 'LOW: Well optimized workspace'
    END as optimization_priority
FROM mcp.cost_optimization.daily_cost_performance co
JOIN mcp.query_optimization.mv_daily_performance qo 
    ON co.workspace_id = qo.workspace_id
WHERE co.date >= current_date() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS
    AND qo.query_date >= current_date() - INTERVAL 7 DAYS
GROUP BY co.workspace_id, co.workspace_name, co.efficiency_score, qo.avg_optimization_score
ORDER BY combined_efficiency_score ASC;
```
